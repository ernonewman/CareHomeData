## Using with Visual Studio based projects/solutions
When using this folder structure with Visual Studio based projects, you should 
start by creating a "Blank Solution" for your project which should create the 
base folder where your code will be stored.

After this folder is created, you should copy the files and folders, excluding 
the ".git" and ".vs" folders, from this project to the main solution folder.

Next, you should use Visual Studio to create "Solution Folders" to match the 
folders from this project. Once these are created, it is up to you whether you
add the individual Markdown files to their respective Solution folders. While 
it is not required, it is suggested that you at least add the README.md file, 
yes this one you are reading, to the solution. You should use this file to 
provide basic details related to the project.
